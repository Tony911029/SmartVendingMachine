# SmartVendingMachine

This is the user interface

Ideally, people can download the published app (something that can be added in the future)

Users can check the items that are currently being sold and how many are still left

Ideally, people can send the feedback to the backend (like comments)

I am also hoping people can order the items from there and just pick up at the vending machine
